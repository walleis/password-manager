Py-ssword - Simple Password Manager

Py-ssword is a lightweight password manager built in Python using the Tkinter library. It allows users to generate secure random passwords, save login information (website, email/username, and password) to a text file, and copy generated passwords to the clipboard. The program includes basic validations to ensure fields are filled correctly and that the email has a valid format.

Features
Secure Password Generation: Generate random passwords with:
8 to 10 letters (uppercase and lowercase).
2 to 4 numbers.
2 to 4 symbols.
Clipboard Support: Automatically copies the generated password to the clipboard using pyperclip.
Field Validation: Ensures all fields are filled and the email contains @ and .com.
Password Storage: Saves login information to a passwords.txt file.
Dynamic Feedback: Displays labels to inform the user when a password is copied or saved.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design with Tkinter.
